title: "Call for Participation on MSc thesis collaborations between companies and universities"
---

The VERSEN working group on Masterâ€™s Thesis Projects has just launched a website with a Call for Participation on MSc thesis collaborations between companies and universities. This call is for companies that are  interested in collaborating with a university in the Netherlands through MSc thesis internships on software science and engineering. To support this collaboration, VERSEN offer a matchmaking platform for connecting companies with research groups that fit the needs of your project ideas. Companies that have research ideas that do not fit already existing collaborations with VERSEN partners, can contact us with their idea, and we will help to find a suitable research group. More information can be found [here](https://www.versen.nl/contents/works/masters-thesis-projects-call-for-participation).
