title: "Europe needs strong software!"
---

Software engineering research is crucial for a strong and independent Europe. A small group of software researchers from France, Finland, and the Netherlands, have written a one-page document as a call to action for increased funding of software engineering research in Europe. This document can be found here:

The one-pager is the basis for an online petition to make a strong statement backed by organizations and software researchers in Europe and elsewhere, to signal to policy-makers (both national and European-level) the urgency of increased funding for software research:

If you want to endorse the message for a strong Europe, with strong software engineering research, sign the petition!
And distribute among colleagues, heads of departments, policy makers, etc. Don't hesitate to share on social media using the hashtags #EuropeNeedsSoftwareResearch #FundSofwareResearchEU.

The document and petition is an effort by Paris Avgeriou, Marieke Huisman, Jean-Marc Jezequel, Tomi Männistö, Tommi Mikonen, Romain Rouvoy, Alexander Serebrenik, Kari Smolander, Tijs van der Storm, on behalf of the national software engineering associations [VERSEN](https://www.versen.nl), [GDR GPL](https://gdr-gpl.cnrs.fr/), and [TIVIA](https://tivia.fi/in-english/).
