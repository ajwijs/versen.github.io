title: "VERSEN Slack Channel - Working Group members wanted!"
---

We have recently established a working group regarding the **VERSEN Slack channel**. The goal of the working group is to boost the participation of community members in Slack by adding content, triggering discussions, and scouting new members to be invited.

The VERSEN Slack team aims to tie together software engineering researchers in the Netherlands in an informal, peer-to-peer manner, via a quick communication medium that complements the website and the mailing list. Through the Slack channel, researchers can share job opportunities, advertise their events including graduations, seek for help or collaborators, or "just" socialize in an environment that connects the whole VERSEN community.

We are looking for volunteers to join the team! If interested, please contact Fabiano Dalpiaz via e-mail ([f.dalpiaz@uu.nl](mailto:f.dalpiaz@uu.nl)) or via the Slack channel itself: [slack://app?team=versen](slack://app?team=versen)
