<p>Patricia Lago, Anna Bon, and Wendelien Tuyp received a grant from the <a href="https://agci.vu.nl/en">Amsterdam Sustainability Institute</a> (ASI) on food security in developing countries.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The objectives of the project are:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Goal-ICT: to focus on the ICT needs, and frame the sustainability concerns relevant for designing context-sensitive solutions for food security in developing countries.</li>
	<li>Goal-Social: to study the policy context and constraints, and aim at formulating a policy that helps optimizing the aids meant to help sustainable livelihoods for farmers at the local level.</li>
</ul>

<p>This research will pilot the application of an interdisciplinary approach called &ldquo;Decision Maps&rdquo; so far applied to ICT solutions for Urban Futures, on the question of how to improve the seed production in Mali in a sustainable<br />
way. It does so based on locally-collected information from the farmers and farmer organizations.</p>

<p>Congrats!</p>
