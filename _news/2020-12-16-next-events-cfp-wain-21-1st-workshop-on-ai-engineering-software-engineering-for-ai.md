-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
In development and implementation of AI-based systems , the main challenge is not to develop the best models/algorithms, but to provide support for the entire<br />
lifecycle - from a business idea, through collection and management of data, software development managing both data and code, product deployment and<br />
operation, and to its evolution. There is a clear need for specific support of Software Engineering for AI.<br />
The aim of the workshop is to bring together researchers and practitioners in software engineering, in data-science and AI, and to build up a community that will target the new challenges emerging in Software Engineering that AI/data-science engineers and software engineers are facing in development of AI-based systems. The workshop will be highly interactive: In addition to the invited keynotes and short paper presentations, there will be several discussion sessions.<br />
