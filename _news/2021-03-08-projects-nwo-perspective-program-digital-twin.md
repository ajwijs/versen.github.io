title: "NWO Perspective program DIGITAL TWIN"
---

The NWO Perspective program DIGITAL TWIN develops methods to make accurate digital twins of high-tech systems: virtual versions that allow you to run simulations to e.g. predict impact of design changes or do predictive maintenance. The project aims to link theoretical models that assume normal behavior with measurement data and combining this data with artificial intelligence, in order to make digital copies that continuously improve and adapt themselves. The research focuses on a number of exemplary systems provided by the Dutch high-tech companies involved in the program.

Three PhD students—Hossain Muctadir, David Manrique Negrin and Raghavendran Gunasekaran—have joined the project in recent months. The R&D activities will be focused on the efficient creation of digital twins using model-driven software engineering techniques; and ensuring consistency between these models as well as early identification of inconsistencies in order to ensure a trustworthy digital twin.
