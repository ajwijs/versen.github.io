title: "Projects - Outreach project Beauty and Joy of Computing in Dutch schools"
---

<p>The National Association of Vice-deans of the Exact Science Faculties has decided to fund the outreach project &quot;<em>Beauty and Joy of Computing in het Nederlands (BJoC-NL) van, voor en door docenten en leerlingen</em>&quot; jointly submitted by <a href="https://nl.linkedin.com/in/moorlag">Ramon Moorlag</a> (National association of computer science secondary school teachers, i&amp;i), <a href="https://www.felienne.com/">Felienne Hermans</a> (University of Leiden) and <a href="https://www.tue.nl/en/research/researchers/alexander-serebrenik/">Alexander Serebrenik</a> (Eindhoven University of Technology).<br />
<br />
&quot;<em>Beauty and Joy of Computing</em>&quot; is a computer science course designed at the University of California, Berkeley. This course aims at introducing programming to secondary school students by stressing creativity without compromising on programming skills. &quot;<em>Beauty and Joy of Computing</em>&quot; has successfully attracted more female students than ever before.<br />
<br />
In our previous project, supported by the 4TU federation we have focussed on translating the basic parts of &quot;<em>Beauty and Joy of Computing</em>&quot; to Dutch and adapting it to the societal context of the Netherlands. The new project will help us to finalise the translation as well as to deploy it in several schools.<br />
