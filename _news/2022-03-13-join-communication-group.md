title: "Join the Communication Plan Working Group"
---

We are looking for people interested in actively contributing to the "Communication Plan" working group.

The goal of this working group is to formulate a communication plan for VERSEN that supports its strategic goals. In this context, communication can be internal (within the VERSEN community) but also external, so as to reach out and engage with VERSEN's external stakeholders (industrial partners, companies, funding agencies, national bodies as well as broad audiences).

At this point, the communication plan is under development, and getting input for the whole community is instrumental in this task. It would be particularly interesting to have young researchers and faculty from different universities, so as to make sure that all different voices, expertises, and groups are represented.

If you are interested or have questions, do not hesitate to contact Jorge PÃ©rez (j.a.perez@rug.nl), leader of the working group.
