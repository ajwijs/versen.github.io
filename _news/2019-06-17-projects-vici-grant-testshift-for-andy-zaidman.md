<p><a href="https://azaidman.github.io/">Andy Zaidman</a> (TU Delft) was awarded the prestigious NWO Vici grant for his <a href="https://www.tudelft.nl/en/2019/ewi/prestigious-vici-grant-for-andy-zaidman/">TestShift</a> proposal.</p>

<p>TestShift will study how software team dynamics influence software testing culture in general and specific approaches in particular. At the level of individual software engineers, TestShift studies whether software engineers benefit from insight in software testing through test analytics. Software engineers will thus be able to gauge cause and effect of their efforts, giving them a sense of purpose for testing. Finally, TestShift investigates advanced visualisation approaches geared towards understanding the intricacies of both newly created and existing developer test scenarios.</p>
