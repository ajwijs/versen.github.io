The VERSEN Msc Thesis Awards have been created to encourage excellent research in the domain of Software Engineering in the Netherlands. We are again able to award the VERSEN Msc thesis awards with support of [NWO](https://www.nwo.nl/) and [HCL Technologies](https://www.hcltech.com/). 

The members of the jury, Jorge A. Perez, Slinger Jansen, and Patricia Lago, used the following criteria for judging:

- Novelty to and impact in the field promoted by VERSEN.
- Timeliness.
- Quality of the thesis report and associated artifacts.
- Methodological approach and execution.

The VERSEN Msc Thesis Awards were announced at ICT.Open 2020. Soon, a video registration of the online event will follow.
