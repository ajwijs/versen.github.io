#Call for papers: 1st International Workshop on Mining Software Repositories for Software Architecture (MSR4SA'21)  

- Website: [https://msr4sa.github.io/msr4sa2021](https://msr4sa.github.io/msr4sa2021/)
- Co-located with [ECSA 2021](https://conf.researchr.org/home/ecsa-2021) 
- Virtual
- September, 2021

## Theme & Goals
Mining software repositories (MSR) became essential to support several software architectural design activities, such as architectural recovery, architectural knowledge capturing, mining architectural tactics, etc. Nevertheless, MSR to support software architecture (SA) is a challenging task, which requires expertise and focus. Moreover, MSR and SA are two separate communities with a small intersection. On the one hand, SA researchers are concerned with proposing approaches to support architectural activities. On the other hand, the MSR community exploits different software repositories, and applies systematically many data mining techniques.

The goal of MSR4SA is to gather researchers and practitioners from both the MSR and SA communities to create the starting point for a dedicated research community, which focusses on applying MSR techniques to resolve architectural problems. Moreover, we aim to create the first future research agenda for the research area of MSR for SA.

## Keynote

We are happy to host a keynote talk by [Nenad Medvidovic](https://viterbi.usc.edu/directory/faculty/Medvidovic/Nenad) on **Mining Architectural Information to Stem Technical Debt**.

## Submissions 

Prospective participants are invited to submit:
- **Research papers** presenting novel contributions on mining software repositories for software architecture (max. 10 pages)
- **Industry papers** which shows the application and challenges of MSR techniques for SA (max. 6 pages)
- **Dataset and tool papers** on MSR for SA (max. 6 pages)

In addition to the workshop publications, we aim to publish the first research agenda to MSR for SA. This will be based on the discussions within the MSR4SA 2021 workshop, and thus all workshop participants will be included as authors in a joint publication.

## Important Dates 
- Paper submissions due: June 25, 2021 (AoE time)
- Notification to authors: July 16, 2021 (AoE time)
- Camera-ready copies due: July 29, 2021 (AoE time)
