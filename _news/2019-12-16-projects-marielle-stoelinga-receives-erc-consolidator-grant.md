<p>Self-driving cars, drones, the Internet of Things; these are just a few of the technologies that could have a significant impact on our lives in the coming years. But this also means that we must carefully weigh the risks against the potential benefits. University of Twente Professor of Risk Management for High-Tech Systems <a href="https://wwwhome.ewi.utwente.nl/~marielle/">Mari&euml;lle Stoelinga</a>, has been awarded an <a href="https://erc.europa.eu/funding/consolidator-grants">ERC Consolidator Grant</a> by the European Research Council that will allow her to develop a new and superior model for making improved and integrated assessments that take both safety and security risks into account.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Congrats!</p>
