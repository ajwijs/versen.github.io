Starting from July 1, 2020 <a href="https://www.win.tue.nl/~aserebre/">Alexander Serebrenik</a> has been appointed a <strong>Full Professor Social Software Engineering</strong> at Eindhoven University of Technology. His research goal is to facilitate evolution of software by taking into account social aspects of software development. His work tends to involve theories and methods both from within computer science (e.g., theory of socio-technical coordination; methods from natural language processing, machine learning) and from outside of computer science (e.g., organisational psychology). The underlying idea of his work is that of empiricism, i.e., that addressing software engineering challenges should be grounded in observation and experimentation, and requires a combination of the social and the technical perspectives. He has won multiple best paper and distinguished reviewer awards, and currently acts as the secretary of VERSEN.</p>

<p>Congrats Alexander!</p>
