[Georgiana Caltais](https://personen.utwente.nl/g.g.c.caltais) is appointed as Assistant Professor at the Formal Methods & Tools group at the University of Twente. Previously, she worked as a post-doc at the University of Konstanz in Germany, and at ETH Zürich in Switzerland. Her research centres around (co-)algebraic frameworks and the techniques they support to model, analyse and improve the correctness and reliability of software and systems. Georgiana’s most recent work includes research on causal inference for various models of computation. In the future, she is looking forward to teaching courses related to formal methods and best software engineering practices, and expanding her research activities to data-driven approaches to the quantitative, causal analysis of dynamic system behaviours.
