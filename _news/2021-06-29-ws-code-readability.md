title: "1st Workshop on Automated Support to Improve code Readability"
---

The Workshop on Automated Support to Improve code Readability (AeSIR) aims at providing a forum for researchers and practitioners to discuss both new approaches and emerging results related to such automated prediction and improvement of code legibility, readability, and understandability. AeSIR solicits both full papers, describing original and unpublished results (up to 5 pages) and short papers, discussing new ideas, insights and preliminary results (up to 2 pages). The topics of interest include (but are not limited to):

Novel tools and approaches for automatically measuring and improving code legibility, readability, and understandability;
New techniques for automatically measuring and improving legibility, readability, and understandability in manually written and automatically generated test cases;
Empirical studies on common practices used to handle code legibility, readability, and understandability evolution;
Case studies of real-world applications;
Replication studies on state-of-the-art tools and techniques for measuring and improving code legibility, readability, and understandability.
The 1st edition of the Workshop on Automated Support to Improve code Readability (AeSIR) will be held virtually on 15 November 2021, co-located with ASE 2021.
