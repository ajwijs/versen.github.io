Estimating software development effort is an essential part of getting new or improved software products to its intended end-users.</p>

<p>An effort estimate sets the expectations of the end-users as to when the software will be ready and what it will cost. Multiple sources show that estimating software development effort has a bad track-record, despite over fourty years of research on good software estimating practices.</p>
