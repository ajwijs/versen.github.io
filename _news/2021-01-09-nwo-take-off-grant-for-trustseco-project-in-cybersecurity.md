Recently, dr. [Slinger Jansen](https://slingerjansen.nl/) embarked on an initiative to secure the software ecosystem through distributed ledger technology and empirical software engineering. In essence, the team is creating a trust infrastructure under the software ecosystem of package managers, open source hubs, and systems using software. As part of this initiative, he and his team obtained a Take-off grant (40k euro) to explore how the TrustSECO project could result into business innovation in the domain of Cybersecurity.

More information about the Take-off grant and the TrustSECO project can be found on their respective websites:
