title: "Best paper at RE'21 for collaboration UU-KMar on Crowd-based RE"
---

The paper "CrowdRE in a Governmental Setting: Lessons from Two Case Studies" was presented by Jelle Wouters on September 23 at the IEEE International Requirements Engineering Conference, held online, and it received a distinction as best industrial innovation paper.

This work is a collaboration between Utrecht University (Dr. Fabiano Dalpiaz and Prof. Sjaak Brinkkemper) and the Royal Netherlands Marechaussee (KMar). In his master's thesis in business informatics at UU, which resulted in the awarded paper, Jelle Wouters conducted canonical action research at the KMar in the field of Crowd-based Requirements Engineering (CrowdRE). 

In this study, over 500 operational employees (typically marginally involved in elicitation activities) participated actively in the crowd-based elicitation of requirements for two software systems by providing 110 ideas and by casting over 800 votes. Besides the size of the crowd, the results show that the participants appreciated being involved in the process, and that several ideas were novel and creative.
