Lauren Olson started as PhD student in the S2 group at VU Amsterdam. Lauren’s research project focuses on designing and implementing conversational agents to assure user feedback’s actionability on software applications and to gather users’ ethical concerns on those software products. User feedback aggregates on social media and specialized feedback platforms in an unstructured manner; when gathered and collated, this data provides insight into users’ experiences and can then be used for automatic classification and summary of feedback. She will then develop a conversational agent that asks users from diverse backgrounds about their ethical concerns with software applications to ensure missing functional and non-functional requirements are addressed.

Her daily supervision will be done by Dr. Emitzá Guzmán (S2 group, VU) and Dr. Florian Kunneman (Social AI group, VU) and began the project on November 1st, 2021.
