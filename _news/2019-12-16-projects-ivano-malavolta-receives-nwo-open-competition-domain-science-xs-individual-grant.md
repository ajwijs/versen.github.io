<p>With his project titled &quot;<strong>Green Tactics for Robotics Software</strong>&quot;,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.ivanomalavolta.com">Ivano Malavolta</a>, assistant professor at the VU&nbsp;receives an&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nwo.nl/en/funding/our-funding-instruments/enw/open-competition/nwo-open-competition-domain-science---xs/open-competition-domain-science---xs.html">NWO Open Competition Domain Science XS</a>&nbsp;grant.</p>

<p>The project is funding a postdoc position for 9 months or a scientific programmer&nbsp;position for 12 months, so if you know someone who may be interested in the position, please get in touch with Ivano Malavolta (<a href="mailto:i.malavolta@vu.nl">i.malavolta@vu.nl</a>).&nbsp;The project is planned to start next March 2020.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Abstract.&nbsp;</strong>From autonomous vehicles, to healthcare, and even in outer space, robots are part of our daily life. Energy is a critical factor for robotic systems, especially for mobile robots where energy is a finite resource (e.g., surveillance autonomous rovers). However, despite the advances in electronics and mechanics, one of the main barriers in robotics is&nbsp;<em>software</em>, since it is becoming massively large, complex, and difficult to measure. The project will break this barrier by allowing roboticists to design energy-efficient robotics software via experimentally-validated green tactics. Green tactics will emerge by mining millions of lines of code of real- world robotics software.</p>
