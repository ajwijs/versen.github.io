---

<p><a href="https://www.tvandijk.nl/">Tom van Dijk</a>&#39;s Marie Curie project PIGGY&nbsp;started in April 2020.</p>

<p>Among others, the main objective of the project is to either:</p>

<ul>
	<li>reason how parity games separate P and NP by being solved in at least quasi-polynomial time&nbsp;</li>
	<li>find an algorithm that solves parity games in polynomial time</li>
</ul>

<p>In order to achieve those goals, Tom studies&nbsp;how algorithms reason about parity games by looking specifically at so-called <em>tangles</em>&nbsp;and how their presence in parity games can make solving for any particular solver &quot;hard&quot;.</p>

<p>Further information about the project can be found <a href="https://www.utwente.nl/en/eemcs/fmt/research/projects/piggy/">here</a>. Good luck Tom with your project!</p>
