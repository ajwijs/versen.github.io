<p>The research &ldquo;<a href="https://robertoverdecchia.github.io/papers/ICSE_2019.pdf">Scalable Approaches for Test Suite Reduction</a>&ldquo;, co-authored by <a href="https://robertoverdecchia.github.io">Roberto Verdecchia</a>, a double-Ph.D. Candidate of the S2Group (Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam) and of CS@GSSI group (Gran Sasso Science Institute), has been selected as one of the <strong>ICSE 2019</strong> ACM SIGSOFT Distinguished Paper awardees. Distinguished Papers represent the very best contributions to the Technical Track of ICSE, the premiere annual conference in the field of software engineering.</p>

<p>The research was carried out jointly with co-authors Emilio Cruciani (Gran Sasso Science Institute), Breno Miranda (Federal University of Pernambuco) and Antonia Bertolino (Italian National Research Council). It presents an effective and efficient algorithm to reduce large test suites, an issue that currently affects many software development companies.</p>

<p>This remarkable achievement reflects well the ongoing effort of the S2Group to target both high scientific quality and industrial relevance.</p>
