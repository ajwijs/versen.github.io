The new "Effective Software Testing" book by Maurício Aniche (Assistant Professor in Software Engineering at TU Delft), published by Manning, is now in press.

The book touches on topics like specification-based testing, code coverage, mocking, design for testability, property-based testing, integration testing, and more. The book is based on Maurício's experience in industry as well as in academia, and contains more than 40 figures and 100 code snippets.

The early version of the book was already being used by TU Delft, University of Zurich, and University of Victoria. If you teach software testing and are looking for a pragmatic resource, feel free to contact Maurício.
