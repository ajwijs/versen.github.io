As of October 1, Thomas Neele will start in a Tenure Track position in the Formal System Analysis group, being led by Tim Willemse. He will be working on the automatic verification of modal properties on systems with very (really very!) large state spaces, that may even be infinite. Thomas Neele defended his prize-winning PhD thesis in September 2020 in which he showed how to verify properties on large state spaces by employing automated reasoning. This also allowed him to naturally add time although that is making the state space uncountably infinite. He also showed how to use partial order reduction, while in the meantime structurally improving its basic theory.
