During the last months, we have continued to make people aware of the software manifesto. In particular, a small working group has been created that writes a document about software technology challenges for AI, together with people from the Dutch AI coalition. The software manifesto also has been mentioned in the newsletter of Informatics Europe.<br />
<br />
In addition, we will meet the advisory board end of October.<br />
<br />
Finally, we are also starting up preparations for our other regular activities. The call for the VERSEN PhD and Master thesis awards will be opened again. We have also started preparations for the SEN symposium, which will take place on February 12, 2021. Nils Jansen (Nijmegen), Helle Hvid Hansen (Groningen) and Ilias Gerostathopoulos (VU) kindly agreed to be this year&#39;s organisers. More information about the setup of the event will follow.<br />
