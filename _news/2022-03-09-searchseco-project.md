title: "SearchSECO: A Worldwide Source Code Index for Scientific Software FAIRness"
---

The Secure Software Ecosystems group at Utrecht University has been awarded a grant by the eScience Center for a PhD student. The project aims to measure impact of scientific software by mining the worldwide software ecosystem for reuse of software components, algorithms, and even pseudocode. If the project is successful, it advances the Research Software Directory of the eScience Center.

The project is dependent on the SearchSECO research infrastructure, one of the largest distributed databases of source code worldwide, that takes software methods as the starting point. SearchSECO can be used for (relatively) fast clone detection in large projects, clone detection within project versions, vulnerability detection, and license violation detection.
