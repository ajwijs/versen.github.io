title: "Petition: Europe needs strong software research"
---

With a small group of software researchers from France and Finland, the VERSEN executive board has written a one-page document as a call to action for increased funding of software engineering research in Europe. You can find the document (PDF) [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Pn4HINXQI2SSsyF051xOzxfEjxzGeEoW/view?usp=sharing).

We have further turned the document into an online petition to make a strong statement backed by organizations and software researchers in Europe and elsewhere, to signal to policy-makers (both national and European-level) the urgency of increased funding for software research:

Please sign our petition and call for aggressive funding of software research, and leveraging the expertise that Europe has to offer, to remain autonomous and stay ahead of the curve.
