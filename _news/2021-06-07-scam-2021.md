title: "Call for papers: 21st IEEE International Working Conference on Source Code Analysis and Manipulation (SCAM)"
---

SCAM aims to bring together researchers and practitioners working on theory, techniques and applications which concern analysis and/or manipulation of the source code of computer systems. For the purpose of clarity ‘source code’ is taken to mean any fully executable description of a software system. It is therefore so-construed as to include machine code, very high level languages and executable graphical representations of systems. The term ‘analysis’ is taken to mean any automated or semi automated procedure which takes source code and yields insight into its meaning. The term ‘manipulation’ is taken to mean any automated or semi-automated procedure which takes and returns source code.

We are currently accepting submissions for different tracks of the 21st IEEE International Working Conference on Source Code Analysis and Manipulation (IEEE SCAM 2021). Conference proceedings will be published by IEEE CS and made available through the IEEE Digital Library.

### Tracks
* Research (10 pages + 2 pages for bibliographic references only): contributions on theory, techniques, and applications that concern analysis and/or manipulation of the source code of software systems.
* Engineering (6 pages): papers that discuss the innovations and solutions to practical problems that researchers and practitioners face in source code analysis and manipulation of software systems.        
* Replication and Negative Results (RENE, 10 pages + 2 pages for bibliographic references only): for papers reporting (1) replications of previous empirical studies (including controlled experiments, case studies, and surveys) and (2) important and relevant negative or null results (i.e., results that failed to show an effect, but help to eliminate useless hypotheses.        
* New Ideas and Emerging Results (NIER, 5 pages): present, discuss, and polish early-stage research. This early-stage research should be innovative and have the potential to make a strong future impact on the research or practice of software engineering.
* Artifact Evaluation Track: The combined AE track will introduce the artifact evaluation for the first time to SCAM! Authors of (short and long) papers accepted in the ICSME, SCAM, or VISSOFT 2021 are invited to submit their artifacts for evaluation to the ICSME 2021 Joint Artifact Evaluation Track.
