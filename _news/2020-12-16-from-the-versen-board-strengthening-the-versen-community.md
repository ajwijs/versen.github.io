Over the last years, the VERSEN board members have been actively working on improving the visibility of software research in Dutch computer science. However, we would like to involve the full VERSEN community more in our activities.</p>

<p>In January, we plan to have a meeting to discuss what can be done to achieve this. I invite in particular <em>all young software researchers in the Netherlands</em> to join this meeting, because we would like to hear your voice. If you would like to join, write an email to Marieke Huisman (m.huisman@utwente.nl).</p>
