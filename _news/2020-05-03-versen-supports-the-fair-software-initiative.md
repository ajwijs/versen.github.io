title: "VERSEN Supports the FAIR Software Initiative"
---

<p>The VERSEN Board has decided to vocally endorse the <a href="https://fair-software.nl/about">FAIR Software Initiative</a> and the Five Fair Principles.&nbsp;The FAIR principles are a concept which originated in data management. The acronym stands for Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable. They have served as a flagship for promoting good data management practices, but until recently they were not directly applicable to software. We hope that the FAIR principles will have a positive effect in research software development.</p>

<p>The five principles are:</p>

<ul>
	<li>use a publicly available repository with version control</li>
	<li>add a license</li>
	<li>register your code in a community repository</li>
	<li>enable software citation</li>
	<li>use a software quality checklist</li>
</ul>

<p>Regarding FAIR:</p>

<ul>
	<li>these are simple first steps that should help educate researchers that create software about what to do with it. Each step comes with detailed/concrete guidelines to help them on their way.</li>
	<li>the fair software principles are intentionally not very complete (one step at a time, and the designers have taken care to avoid most subjectivitity around software quality).</li>
	<li>the initiative lifts purposefully on the &quot;fair principles&quot; for research data and the communities already existent around data analytics; that&rsquo;s a smart way of putting software quality on the agenda of stakeholders in data analytics (!)</li>
	<li>endorsed already by NWO, Dans, CWI, SSI, KB, eScience center. &nbsp;see&nbsp;<a href="https://fair-software.nl/endorse">https://fair-software.nl/endorse</a></li>
