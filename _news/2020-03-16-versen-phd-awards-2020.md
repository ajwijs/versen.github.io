<p>The VERSEN PhD Thesis Awards have been created to encourage excellent research in the domain of Software Engineering in the Netherlands. We are again able to award the VERSEN PhD thesis awards with support of <a href="https://www.nwo.nl/">NWO</a> and <a href="https://www.hcltech.com/">HCL Technologies</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The members of the jury, Jan Friso Groote, Slinger Jansen, and Patricia Lago, used the following criteria for judging:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Novelty to and impact in the field promoted by VERSEN.</li>
	<li>Timeliness.</li>
	<li>Quality of the thesis report and associated artifacts.</li>
	<li>Methodological approach and execution.</li>
</ul>

<p>Due to the cancellation of ICT Open and the VERSEN track, we have had to cancel the VERSEN PhD Thesis Award Ceremony. That said, we are able to announce the winners in this manner.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Award Ceremony has been <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWhSCiRxcWQ">organized&nbsp;by NWO through and online video</a> because of Covid-19.</p>

<p>The winners of the VERSEN PhD award are:</p>

<ol>
	<li><strong>dr. Moritz Beller</strong> (Technical University Delft) with the thesis &quot;<em>An Empirical Evaluation of Feedback-Driven Software Development</em>&quot;, supervised by Prof. dr. Andy Zaidman, dr. Georgios Gousios, and Prof. dr. Arie van Deursen.</li>
