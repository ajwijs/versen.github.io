<p><a href="https://gkonat.github.io/">Gabri&euml;l Konat</a>&nbsp;will defend his PhD thesis titled&nbsp;&quot;Language-Parametric Methods for Developing Interactive Programming Systems&quot; on November 18 at 15:00, location Aula Congress Centre, Delft University of Technology.</p>

<p>Hi PhD thesis is about&nbsp;<em>language-parametric methods for developing interactive programming systems</em>. A language-parametric method takes as input a description of a programming language (such as a DSL), and automatically implements (parts of) an interactive programming system, reducing development effort, thereby making programming language development more feasible.</p>
