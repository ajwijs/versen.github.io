**Citation**: *Spoofax is a platform for developing textual domain-specific languages. It is a comprehensive environment that includes the tools to specify new languages, produces language processing tools such as type checkers, compilers, and interpreters, and support for integration in leading IDEs. Spoofax is used in industry and research, e.g., to develop WebDSL - a language that is one of the underpinnings of the researchr system used for many conference websites. Spoofax is rooted in a long line of research going back to the ASF+SDF MetaEnvironment, the SDF2 syntax definition formalism, and the Stratego transformation language. Spoofax is the basis for a line of further research in declarative language definition. This paper is the main scientific publication describing the entire environment in its 1.0 release and documenting the requirements and architecture for a language workbench.*
