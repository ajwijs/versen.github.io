The Software Engineering and Technology cluster at Eindhoven University of Technology is looking for a new colleague. Together we want to build an ecosystem of technologies and tools around knowledge mining, knowledge representation, innovative techniques for analysing/reasoning and exploration of systems, as well as more user-centric and more intuitive interaction such as use of voice and touch for SE-tools, as well as smart software-visualisation tools. The position is currently open for non-men only but will become open to all genders if the position cannot be filled in six months.
