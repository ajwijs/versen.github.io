title: "Slinger Jansen obtains HiTMaT Grant for AI4BigSoft"
---

Together with the [Software Improvement Group](https://www.softwareimprovementgroup.com/) Slinger Jansen and Magiel Bruntink obtained a [HiTMaT seed grant](https://www.hollandhightech.nl/hitmat-call) in the Holland High Tech program valued at 35k Euro. The goal of the project is to explore how we can use artificial intelligence and smart search techniques for uncovering vulnerabilities in the worldwide software ecosystem. The Software Improvement Group regularly reviews source code of large organizations and has access to thousands of repositories in which we are hoping to identify new vulnerabilities, using source code pattern mining and source code mutation analysis. The grant proposal is part of the [SecureSECO initiative](https://secureseco.org/).
