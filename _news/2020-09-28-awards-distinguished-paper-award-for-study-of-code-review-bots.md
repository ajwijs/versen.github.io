Paper studying the effects of code review bots co-authored by <a href="https://www.win.tue.nl/~aserebre/">Alexander Serebrenik</a> (Eindhoven) and his Brazilian and American colleagues has been selected to receive an IEEE TCSE Distinguished Paper Award at the IEEE International Conference on Software Maintenance and Evolution 2020 (<a href="https://icsme2020.github.io/">ICSME</a>).<br />
<br />
In this paper Mairieli Wessel (University of S&atilde;o Paulo, Brazil), Alexander Serebrenik, Igor Wiese (Universidade Tecnol&oacute;gica Federal do Paran&aacute;, Campo Mour&atilde;o, Brazil), Igor Steinmacher (Universidade Tecnol&oacute;gica Federal do Paran&aacute;, Campo Mour&atilde;o, Brazil and Northern Arizona University, USA), and Marco A. Gerosa (Northern Arizona University, USA) have studied the impact of code review bots on pull requests submitted to open source projects. We employed a regression discontinuity design on 1,194 software projects from GitHub. Our results indicate that the adoption of code review bots increases the number of monthly merged pull requests, decreases monthly non-merged pull requests, and decreases communication among developers. Practitioners and maintainers may leverage our results to understand, or even predict, bot effects on their projects&rsquo; social interactions.<br />
