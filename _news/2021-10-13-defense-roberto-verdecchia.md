title: "Roberto Verdecchia (S2 group, VU Amsterdam) successful defence of Double-PhD"
---

Roberto Verdecchia, postdoctoral research associate at the Software and Sustainability (S2) group of the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam (VU), successfully defended his PhD thesis in September 2021.

The thesis was carried out in the context of a Double-PhD program born from the collaboration between the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam (VU) and the Gran Sasso Science Institute (GSSI), L'Aquila, Italy.

The thesis, titled Architectural Technical Debt: Identification and Management", aimed at developing a better understanding of Architectural Technical Debt (ATD), and determine what strategies can be used to identify and manage it. The result of the investigation, deeply grounded in empirical data, advances the field by providing novel insights into ATD
related phenomena, and presenting approaches to pro-actively identify ATD instances, leading to its eventual management and resolution.
