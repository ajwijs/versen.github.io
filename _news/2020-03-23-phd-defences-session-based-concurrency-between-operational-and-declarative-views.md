title: "PhD defences - Session-Based Concurrency: Between Operational and Declarative Views"
---

<p>On January 7, <a href="https://www.mcanog.info/">Mauricio Cano</a> successfully defended his PhD thesis &quot;<em>Session-Based Concurrency: Between Operational and Declarative Views</em>&quot; at the University of Groningen.<br />
<br />
In his thesis, supervised by Prof. dr. <a href="https://www.jperez.nl/">Jorge A. P&eacute;rez</a> and Prof. dr. <a href="https://www.rug.nl/staff/g.r.renardel.de.lavalette/">Gerard Renardel</a>, Mauricio presents a comprehensive study of formal programming models for message-passing concurrency and of their associated verification techniques.<br />
<br />
This PhD work concerns theory of programming, with practical implications. His research&nbsp;develops results of relative expressiveness to integrate program specifications written in operational and declarative styles. A&nbsp;recurrent topic in Mauricio&#39;s work is the use of advanced type systems to characterize the correctness of such relative expressiveness results.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Well done, Mauricio!</p>
