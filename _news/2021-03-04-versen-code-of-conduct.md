title: "VERSEN Code of Conduct"
---

VERSEN has published a "code of conduct" to make abundantly clear that we greatly value a respectful and inclusive community on the one hand, and that we will act appropriately upon misbehaviors on the other hand. The code of conduct is applicable to all communications within the community and also to situations where members of VERSEN represent our community elsewhere. You can find it [here](https://www.versen.nl/contents/about/code-of-conduct).
