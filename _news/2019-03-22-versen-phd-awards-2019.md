	<li><strong>Elvira Maria Arvanitou</strong> (University of Groningen) with the thesis &quot;Proposing and Empirically Validating Change Impact Analysis Metrics&quot;, supervised by Paris Avgeriou. A significant contribution to the domain of metrics in software engineering, while embracing the weaknesses of metrics.</li>
