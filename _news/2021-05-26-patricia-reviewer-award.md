Patricia Lago has been awarded with the **Best Reviewer Award** at the 18th International Conference on Software Architecture (ICSA 2021), congrats!

[ICSA](https://icsa-conferences.org/2021/) is the premier venue for practitioners and researchers interested in software architecture, in component-based software engineering and in quality aspects of software and how these relate to the design of software architectures. ICSA has a strong tradition as a working conference, where researchers meet practitioners and software architects can explain the problems they face in their day-to-day work and try to influence the future of the field.
