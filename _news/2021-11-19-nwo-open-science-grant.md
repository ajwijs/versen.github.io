title: "NWO Open Science funding for project on FAIR Software"
---

Anna-Lena Lamprecht has been awarded a 50K Euros grant from NWO's new Open Science Fund. Together with collaborators from UU Research IT, the Netherlands eScience Center and the international Research Software Alliance, she will work on "Fair metrics for FAIR software", with a focus on finding out which metrics have the greatest potential to incentivize researchers to make their software more FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable) and stimulate change towards Open Science practices. More information about her and the other 25 projects selected in this round are available [here](https://www.nwo.nl/en/researchprogrammes/open-science/open-science-fund/open-science-fund-2021-awarded-grants).
