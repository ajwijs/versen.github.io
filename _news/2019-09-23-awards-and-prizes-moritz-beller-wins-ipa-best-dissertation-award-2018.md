<p><a href="https://inventitech.com/">Moritz Beller&nbsp;</a>wins the IPA Best Dissertation Award 2018 for his PhD thesis entitled&nbsp;<em>An Empirical Evaluation of Feedback-Driven Software Development</em>, in which he investigates how software developers deal with feedback during the development process. To this end he performed empirical research on how software developers deal with testing. He developed an infrastructure supporting automatic telemetry, and used this infrastructure for large scale analysis of software developers&#39; behaviour. Results of his research have lead to improvements in frequently used software development environments (Eclipse en IntelliJ), as well as in the Delft computer science curriculum.&nbsp;</p>
