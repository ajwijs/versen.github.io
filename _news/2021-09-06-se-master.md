A new VERSEN working group is currently being set up on Software Engineering post-Master education. The goal of this group is to investigate the needs of Software Engineers for education at the post-Master level, and how VERSEN can play a role in providing that education. Some current examples of post-Master education are the PDEng programs offered by the Dutch universities of Technology, and part-time programs aimed at professionals working in industry.

If you are interested in being a member of this group, please contact Anton Wijs (A.J.Wijs@tue.nl).
