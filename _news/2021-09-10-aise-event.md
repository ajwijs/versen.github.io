title: "Joint IPA and VERSEN seminar on Artificial Intelligence in Software Engineering"
---

Earlier this year the "VERSEN Community Events" working group was formed to organize regular opportunities for get-togethers and knowledge exchange in the Dutch Software Engineering community. Now that vaccination rates are rising and restrictions being lifted, we are happy to announce that the first event in the series can happen in person!

Together with Research School IPA, we cordially invite you to attend the:

Joint IPA & VERSEN seminar afternoon on "Artificial Intelligence in Software Engineering"
Wednesday, 6th October, 13:00-17:00
Utrecht University, Science Park
Room KBG 1.26 COSMOS, see [https://www.uu.nl/en/victor-j-koningsberger-building](https://www.uu.nl/en/victor-j-koningsberger-building)

Please visit [https://forms.gle/Pts5CzbVrkqfguJs7](https://forms.gle/Pts5CzbVrkqfguJs7) for registration, details and up-to-date information. Unfortunately the still evolving corona regulations make the planning a bit challenging, but we are confident that everything will quickly become more concrete after the government's next press conference.

In the meantime, please note our open call for contributions (short talks):
If you have any work about the seminar topic that you would like to share with the IPA/VERSEN community, we welcome your contribution as a short talk (5-15 min, depending on the number of presentations). Please submit a title and short abstract with your registration. Contributions from young researchers and members of underrepresented groups are particularly appreciated!

In case of any questions, don't hesitate to email a.l.lamprecht@uu.nl

We look forward to seeing you soon!

The VERSEN Community Events working group:
Ã–nder Babur, Loek Cleophas, Anna-Lena Lamprecht
