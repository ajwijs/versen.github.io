title: "Projects - Veni grant on Composable and Safe-by-Construction Programming Language Definitions for Casper Bach Poulsen"

<p><a href="http://casperbp.net">Casper Bach Poulsen</a>&nbsp;(TU Delft) has been awarded an NWO Veni grant for his proposal entitled&nbsp;<em>Composable and Safe-by-Construction Programming Language Definitions</em>.<br />
<br />
Type-checked languages are invaluable tools for developing complex software because they automatically guarantee the absence of certain errors. However, developing and extending type-checked languages is prohibitively hard. This project will develop techniques for safe-by-construction,composable language definitions to facilitate the developmentof new and improved languages.</p>

<p>Congrats Casper!</p>
