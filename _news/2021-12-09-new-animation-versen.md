title: "New animation: Fundamental Computing: Mathematics and logic for software we can all rely on"
---

At the Fundamental Computing group at the [University of Groningen](www.rug.nl/fse/fc), we have recently completed an animated video which explains how we use mathematics and logic to develop software we can all rely on. Our research is thus well-aligned with VERSEN's Software Manifesto, in particular with challenges on "Software Reliability".
