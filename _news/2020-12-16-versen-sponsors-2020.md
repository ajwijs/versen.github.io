title: "From the VERSEN board - VERSEN sponsors 2020"
---


VERSEN membership is free for individuals, mainly because our institutions provide yearly sponsoring. We want to thank our "Platinum" sponsors for 2020, namely NWO-I Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica and TU Delft for providing the bulk of the budget. Among other things, from this money we organize the [SEN symposium](http://www.sen-symposium.nl/), and the [visual story](https://www.dropbox.com/s/jna5nq7wsynmcvh/VERSEN_Manifest_Poster_Lowres.pdf?dl=0) with the [manifesto](https://versen.nl/contents/manifesto).  

Furthermore we have received broad support from our "Gold" sponsors: Universiteit Twente, TU Eindhoven, Universiteit Utrecht, Vrije Universiteit, Universiteit van Amsterdam, Open Universiteit, Rijksuniversiteit Groningen, Wageningen University & Research, and Radboud Universiteit Nijmegen. This sponsoring enables VERSEN to broaden our activities beyond the symposium, in terms of awards, public relations, strategic meetings and conferences. Also our website, newsletter and membership administration are funded by our sponsors.  

We wish to thank our [sponsors](https://versen.nl/contents/sponsors) for their continued support!
