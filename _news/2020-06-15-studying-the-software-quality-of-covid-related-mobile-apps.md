title: "Studying the software quality of COVID-related mobile apps"

<p><a href="https://wwwhome.ewi.utwente.nl/~marielle/">Marielle Stoelinga</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="http://www.ivanomalavolta.com">Ivano Malavolta</a>&nbsp;are collaborating on a study about the <strong>software quality of COVID-related mobile apps</strong>. The idea is to run multiple analyses targeting a large number of&nbsp;COVID-related Android apps&nbsp;in order to characterize if their level of quality&nbsp;is different from that of standard apps published in the Google Play store.&nbsp;This will inform the public and decision makers about how app developers react when subject to huge&nbsp;pressure&nbsp;to deliver and under the unique conditions due to COVID-19.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Technically, the collaboration will make use of open-source products, like <a href="https://www.sonarqube.org/">SonarQube</a>&nbsp;and Ivano&#39;s <a href="https://github.com/iivanoo/covid-apps-observer">COVID apps observer</a>.</p>
