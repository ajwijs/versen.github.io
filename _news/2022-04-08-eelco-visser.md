We are shaken and heartbroken to learn about the sudden passing of Eelco Visser, professor and head of the Programming Languages Group at Delft University of Technology, member of the Dutch National Association for Software Engineering (VERSEN) and a dear friend, colleague and mentor to many of us.

Eelco has been an active member of VERSEN: when in 2013 VERSEN has organised the software engineering track at ICT Open, the Dutch national ICT congress, Eelco has given a keynote talk; in 2019 and in 2020 he himself has co-organised a software engineering track at ICT Open on behalf of VERSEN. He has been one of the co-authors of the Manifesto on Software Research and Education in the Netherlands, and has always been active in numerous discussions about the future of software engineering research, shaping the landscape of the Dutch software engineering research.

Eelco has also worked to bridge software engineering and formal methods, initiating and co-organising workshops, co-defining the research agenda for formal methods research in Netherlands, as well as highlighting the synergy of these fields in a keynote talk.

Eelco is severely missed, and our thoughts are with his family and friends.

A farewell community for Eelco is available at [https://www.scribecommunities.nl/community/DLF543NBA](https://www.scribecommunities.nl/community/DLF543NBA)

Your memories and pictures will serve a basis of a remembrance book for Eelcoâ€™s family.
