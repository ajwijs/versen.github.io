## Contributions


VERSEN exists by the generous contributions that the association receives. 

VERSEN membership is free for individuals, mainly because our institutions provide yearly sponsoring. From this money we organize the [SEN symposium](http://www.sen-symposium.nl/), and the visual story with the [VERSEN manifesto](https://www.versen.nl/contents/manifesto). Also our website, newsletter and membership administration are funded by our sponsors.

We want to thank our "Platinum" contributors; **NWO-I Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica and TU Delft** for providing the bulk of the budget. In 2022 the SPIder organization also donated a very sizable amount. Thank you!

Furthermore we have received broad support from our "Gold" contributors **Universiteit Twente, TU Eindhoven, Universiteit Utrecht, Universiteit Leiden, Vrije Universiteit, Universiteit van Amsterdam, Open Universiteit, Rijksuniversiteit Groningen, Wageningen University & Research, and Radboud Universiteit Nijmegen**. This sponsoring enables VERSEN to broaden our activities beyond the symposium, in terms of awards, public relations, strategic meetings and conferences.
