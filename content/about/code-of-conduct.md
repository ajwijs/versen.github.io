## VERSEN Code of Conduct v1.0.0

As members of the VERSEN community, we pledge to respect all people who participate in our community and who interact with our community. We are committed to making participation in this community an inclusive and harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of level of experience, gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, personal appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, age, or religion.

Examples of unacceptable behavior by members include the use of sexual language or imagery, derogatory comments or personal attacks, trolling, public or private harassment, insults, or other unprofessional conduct.

VERSEN board members and VERSEN working group leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject messages (or any other form of communication) that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct. Members who do not follow the Code of Conduct may be removed as a member of a VERSEN working group and may be removed from VERSEN membership entirely.

This code of conduct applies not only within VERSEN community spaces --the SEN Symposium, the VERSEN Github organization, the VERSEN Slack team, VERSEN Working Group meetings, files on the VERSEN Google Drive -- but also in public spaces when an individual is representing our community.

If you have witnessed or suffered a instance of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior you are encouraged to contact any or all of these people:
* the respective Working Group lead
* the current [chair of VERSEN](/contents/board)
* [Alexander Serebrenik](mailto://aserebre@win.tue.nl)
* [Jurgen Vinju](mailto://jurgen.vinju@cwi.nl)

Your story will be treated with the respect and privacy required, and will therefore be off-the-record. You may decide to log a formal complaint, which is to be communicated via email to the current chair of VERSEN. We can advise you and help you through the process. If the current chair of VERSEN has apparently violated our code of conduct, then the formal complaint should be sent to all members of the executive board, excluding the chair.

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the "Contributor Covenant", version 1.1.0, available at <https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/1/1/0/code-of-conduct.html>
