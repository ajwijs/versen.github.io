## Working Groups

The VERSEN community is organized in Working Groups. Some of them are temporary and some of them are permanent. They each have a specific goal and a managable number of members that collaborate towards this goal.

* [Executive Board](/contents/works/executive-board): manages and animates the entire VERSEN community. They also have formal responsibilities as listed in the VERSEN charter.
* [Web](/contents/works/web): manages, implements and maintains the VERSEN website, the member administration and mailing lists;
* [Symposium](/contents/works/symposium) comprises the people that organize the yearly SEN symposium. Its members are different every year.
* [Publicity](/contents/works/publicity) has to goal to create and edit content for the newsletter and the website;

## Participation

* If you would like to participate in an existing Working Group, please contact its Lead person;

* Each VERSEN member is committed to our [Code of Conduct](/contents/about/code-of-conduct), especially so when participating in one of our working groups.
