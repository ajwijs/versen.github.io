VERSEN grew out of the open meetings at the end of the yearly [SEN symposium](/contents/works/symposium) in 2014 and 2016.

The initiators of VERSEN were:

* Jurgen Vinju 
* Frank de Boer
* Sjaak Brinkkemper

The VERSEN board was bootstrapped by inviting practically all software professors in The Netherlands to its board. Everybody accepted.

VERSEN was funded via the budget of the software "societal theme" at Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica.
