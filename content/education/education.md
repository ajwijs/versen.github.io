## VERSEN Educational Activities

The [Education working group](/contents/works/education) explores how software engineering education can be improved across all levels. The group monitors similarities and differences of CS curricula across the country to foster collaboration at the course level.

The [Post-master Education working group](/contents/works/se-postmaster) investigates the needs of Software Engineers for education at the post-Master level. Examples of such activities are the PDEng programs and part-time programs aimed at professionals working in the industry.

The [Master's Thesis Projects working group](/contents/works/masters-thesis-projects) aims at providing a national platform for Master thesis projects in software research. The group expects to build a bridge between master students and companies in this process.
